# Contracts

Real World Trade Protocol is currently implemented for the EVM and deployed across many different chains. However, it seems reasonable that RWTP could be implemented for other smart contract platforms.

## Orders

RWTP has both BuyOrders and SellOrders. If you make a buy order, folks offer to sell you things. If you make a sell order, folks offer to buy your things. Both are defined by the `Order` contract.

### Making an offer

To make an offer on an order, you can use the `submitOffer` function. As the market maker, you get to decide the deal.

```solidity
offer.submitOffer(
  // a uint32 that identifies the order
  index,

  // a uint128 that represents the price to be paid in the token the order specifies
  price,

  // A uint128 that represents what you'd like the buyer to use as a cost,
  // as defined in the Whitepaper
  buyersCost,

  // A uint128 that represents what you'd like the seller to stake, as defined in the Whitepaper
  sellersStake,

  // An arbitrary URI to metadata
  uri
);
```
