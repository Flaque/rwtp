# Quick Start

Let's install [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/), [rwtp](https://github.com/rwtp/rwtp), and a few other useful helpers. The `rwtp` npm package is not the protocol itself, but a client that contains useful helpers for interacting with it.

```bash
yarn add rwtp ethers graphql-request graphql
```

## Connect to Ethereum

You'll need a testnet RPC endpoint. You can get one for free from [infura.io](https://infura.io). You may also want some testnet ETH, you can get some from a faucet, [like this one](https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/).

```ts
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('YourEndpoint');
```

## Connect to an OrderBook

An order book is a master list of all the buy and sell orders.

```ts
import { OrderBook } from 'rwtp';

// ...

const book = new ethers.Contract(OrderBook.address, OrderBook.abi, provider);
```

## Create a Sell & Buy Order

Use the OrderBook to create a new sell order. You'll need a URI to metadata. For the moment, we'll use [an IPFS hash for some metadata we've already uploaded.](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmRrTgcD3KqdCbnYeTGnpnMQpoko7juCEb5LzsjM75Dmbr)

```ts
const tx = await book.createOrder(
  // address of the seller
  provider.address,

  // Metadata
  'ipfs://QmRrTgcD3KqdCbnYeTGnpnMQpoko7juCEb5LzsjM75Dmbr',

  // isBuyOrder = false
  false
);

await tx.wait();
```

You can make a buy order by flipping the `isBuyOrder` to true.

```ts
const tx = await book.createOrder(
  // address of the buyer
  provider.address,

  // Metadata
  'ipfs://QmRrTgcD3KqdCbnYeTGnpnMQpoko7juCEb5LzsjM75Dmbr',

  // isBuyOrder = true
  true
);

await tx.wait();
```

## Get orders

You can get a list of orders on the network either by using the GraphQL subgraph.[^1]

```typescript
import { request, gql } from 'graphql-request';

const query = gql`
  {
    orders {
      address
      title
      maker
      priceSuggested
      sellersStakeSuggested
      buyersCostSuggested
    }
  }
`;

const URL = 'https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/jacobpedd/rwtp';

const data = await request(URL, query);

// data.orders[0].address
```

## Connecting to an order

```typescript
import { Order } from 'rwtp';

const order = new ethers.Contract(
  // Some address of an order
  '0x6bf3323273b49ccd62a25df678e0b6051aebe436',
  OrderBook.abi,
  provider
);
```

## Submitting an offer

To purchase from a sell order, or sell to a buy order, you can submit an offer.

```typescript
import { BigNumber } from 'ethers';

function getRandomIndex() {
  return BigNumber.from(Math.floor(Math.random() * Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER));
}

order.submitOffer(
  // A random number to use as an ID.
  getRandomIndex(),

  // the address token, in this case wETH
  '0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2',

  // The price paid by the buyer
  ethers.utils.parseEther('0.1')
);
```
