# Quick Start

Install [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/) and the [rwtp](https://github.com/rwtp/rwtp). The `rwtp` npm package is not the protocol itself, but a client that contains useful helpers for interacting with it.

```bash
yarn add rwtp ethers
```

## Connect to Ethereum

You'll need a testnet RPC endpoint. You can get one for free from [infura.io](https://infura.io). You may also want some testnet ETH, you can get some from a faucet, [like this one](https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/).

```ts
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('YourEndpoint');
```

## Connect to an OrderBook

An order book is a master list of all the buy and sell orders.

```ts
import { OrderBook } from 'rwtp';

// ...

const book = new ethers.Contract(OrderBook.address, OrderBook.abi, provider);
```

## Create a Sell Order

Use the OrderBook to create a new sell order.

```ts
book.createOrder();
```
