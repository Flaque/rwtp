# GraphQL

You can use [the graph](https://thegraph.com/) to query orders with GraphQL. Use [the RWTP subgraph](https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/jacobpedd/rwtp) to query orders.

## Example

Use the following query to grab orders. This subgraph attempts to parse common metadata fields like "title", "priceSuggested", "sellersStakeSuggested", and "buyersCostSuggested".

```graphql
# https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/jacobpedd/rwtp
{
  orders {
    address
    title
    maker
    priceSuggested
    sellersStakeSuggested
    buyersCostSuggested
  }
}
```
