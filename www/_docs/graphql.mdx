# GraphQL

You can use [the graph](https://thegraph.com/) to query orders with GraphQL. Use [the RWTP subgraph](https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/jacobpedd/rwtp) to query orders.

</a>

## Example Query

Use the following query to grab orders. This subgraph attempts to parse common metadata fields like "title", "priceSuggested", "sellersStakeSuggested", and "buyersCostSuggested".

```graphql
# https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/jacobpedd/rwtp
{
  orders {
    address
    title
    maker
    priceSuggested
    sellersStakeSuggested
    buyersCostSuggested
  }
}
```

## Example with graphql-request

Install [graphql-request](https://github.com/prisma-labs/graphql-request) and graphql.

```bash
yarn add graphql-request graphql
```

Then, query the subgraph.

```typescript
import { request, gql } from 'graphql-request';

const query = gql`
  {
    orders {
      address
      title
      maker
      priceSuggested
      sellersStakeSuggested
      buyersCostSuggested
    }
  }
`;

const URL = 'https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/jacobpedd/rwtp';

request(URL, query).then((data) => console.log(data));
```
