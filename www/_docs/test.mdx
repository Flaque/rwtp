# Real World Trade Protocol

RWTP is a peer-to-peer protocol for buying and selling physical goods in untrusted situations.

## Motiviation

By default, a buyer on the internet does not know if, when they order a package, the package will actually be delivered. A nefarious no-good evil-doer could simply claim to be selling laptops, take your $1000, and then never actually ship you a laptop. To prevent fraud, buyers today may use credit-card charge backs.

However, cryptocurrencies do not have chargebacks; sending money to the wrong address is final. So buying real-world goods with cryptocurrencies, especially from unknown parties is dangerous.

One solution is for buyers to only purchase from trusted addresses. The seller may be able to sign a message like "I am Amazon.com" and put that message in a `txt` DNS record and call it a day. However, this solution restricts the ability for new entrants to sell on the internet. The buyer has no way to distinguish between an honest, but new seller, and a scammer. So instead, the new seller is better off selling via a centralized platform such as Amazon.

## Two-sided deposits

To solve the problem of fraud, Real World Trade Protocol requires both the buyer and the seller to put down a deposit. If either party believes the deal failed, both the buyer and the seller lose their deposit.
