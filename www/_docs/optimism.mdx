# Using Optimism

Optimism lets you use Ethereum for about ~$0.5 per transaction instead of the ~$15 you'd pay on Ethereum Mainnet.

Optimism is like a different bank account. You'll need to move your money over, but when you do, every transaction is _much_, _much_ cheaper.

## Moving money from Mainnet to Optimism

To move money from your Mainnet account to your Optimism account, use [the Optimism Bridge.](https://app.optimism.io/bridge)
