# Metadata

RWTP stores things like titles, descriptions, images, shipping address, and contact information off-chain. Client applications should use [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) to store this data.[^1]

## Schema and Accepts

An Order contains a `uri` that _must_ point to a JSON object. That object _must_ contain a minimum of two fields:

```typescript
interface Metadata {
  $type: string;
  $accepts: string[];
}
```

The `$type` field is a URI pointing to a JSON schema defining metadata for the _order_ (such as the title, description, and photos). The `$accepts` field is an array of JSON schema URIs that define metadata for acceptable _offers_ (such as shipping details, contact information, and names).

`$type` says "here's what I'm buying or selling". `$accepts` says "here's how I'd like you to give me an offer".

### Example of a `$type` schema

Given a schema like the following:

```json
{
  "title": "Simple Ecommerce Sell Order Schema",
  "description": "A public billboard",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "title": {
      "title": "Title",
      "description": "The main header describing the item",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "description": {
      "title": "Description",
      "description": "A longer, more detailed description of the item",
      "type": "string"
    }
  },
  "required": ["title", "description"]
}
```

You could upload metadata like the following:

```json
{
  "title": "A 1-bedroom condo near a coffee shop",
  "description": "A cute spot in a cool neighborhood./n Next to the Keychannel cafe."
}
```

### Example of an `$accepts` schema

Given the following schema:

```json
{
  "title": "Simple Ecommerce Offer Schema",
  "description": "Payload for buyer's metadata when the request to purchase an item.",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "shippingAddress": {
      "title": "Shipping Address",
      "description": "Buyer's address to ship the item to.",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "email": {
      "title": "Email",
      "description": "Email of the buyer requesting to buy a Listing.",
      "type": "string",
      "pattern": "^\\S+@\\S+\\.\\S+$",
      "format": "email",
      "minLength": 6,
      "maxLength": 127
    }
  },
  "required": ["email", "shippingAddress"]
}
```

You could encrypt and then upload metadata like the following:

```json
{
  "shippingAddress": "123 Main St",
  "email": "alice@example.org"
}
```
